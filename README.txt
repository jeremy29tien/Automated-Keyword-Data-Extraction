Description of tool functionality.
This computational data extraction tool extracts data (in the form of key sentences) from published journal articles based on user-provided keyword parameters.
Breakdown of functions:
 - PubMed Search
 - Journal Filter
 - Sentence Extraction
 - Summary Generation
 - Spreadsheet Output

Prerequisites.
 - Java SE 6 or higher installed

Installing.
 - The latest version of Java can be downloaded at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
	- You can check your java version on your current machine by opening a terminal window and typing 'java -version' into the command line and hitting Enter.
 - Download the entire folder (if you haven't done so already) called Automated-Keyword-Data-Extraction from the Dropbox at:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g4mmpab6il6mypb/AACp3t1gPoeiUshauihFTCdaa?dl=0

Running the algorithm.
Once Java is installed and Automated-Keyword-Data-Extraction is downloaded, open a terminal window to run the program.
Switch to the directory called Automated-Keyword-Data-Extraction (where all the executable files are located) by using the terminal command cd
For example, if the desired directory is /Users/UserName/Downloads/Automated-Keyword-Data-Extraction/ (where UserName is your username for your current computer), then type in terminal:

cd /Users/UserName/Downloads/Automated-Keyword-Data-Extraction/

and press Enter.

Once you are in the correct directory, run KeywordAlgoJava.java by typing:

java KeywordAlgoJava

into the terminal and pressing Enter.
This will launch the Data Extraction Tool. The tool is interactive and will prompt you for various parameters when necessary.
